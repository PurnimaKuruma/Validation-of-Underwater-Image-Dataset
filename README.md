## 🔧 Folders Overview

Each folder contains the code, dependencies, and instructions for running the respective method:

- `1_DCP`: Dark Channel Prior
- `2_UDCP`: Underwater DCP
- `3_WCIDCP`: Wavelength-Compensated Improved DCP
- `4_Ancient`: Physics-inspired variational method
- `5_PBCCR`: Physics-Based Color Correction and Restoration
- `6_FUIER`: Fusion-based Enhancement of Realistic Underwater Images
- `7_HLP`: Haze Line Prior

> All implementations were adapted and tested on our **synthetic underwater dataset** described below.
